{"name":"US Travel Checklist","tagline":"Experiment using Github as a crowd soucing platform","body":"### What is this?\r\nThis is my fun little experiment to see if Github's crowd source\r\nmodel could be leveraged, given adequate exposure, for something\r\nas simple as a todo list.\r\n\r\n### Why am I doing this?\r\nMost threads I read regarding overseas travel, especially to the US I find overly touristy.\r\nI'm not one for hikes through national parks, or going to Disney Land.\r\n\r\nI want to travel San Francisco the way people should travel Melbourne, Australia.\r\nTalking to locals, wandering the city's laneways for days with no plans. Discovering all\r\nthe hidden awesomeness it has to offer.\r\n\r\nI'll be spending the majority of my time there working with local collegues who I'm sure will show me a great time.\r\nBut I'd like to break away and get lost :) **My intention** is to collect, and curate a set of individual,\r\nuniquely SF experiences that I can share back with you all, and anyone who stumbles across this is via Google :)\r\n\r\n### How can you help?\r\nLong story short, I'm travelling to San Francisco for ~2 months\r\n(Aug/Sep) this year primarily, but by no means limited to, San\r\nFrancisco.\r\nI've been to the US before, spending the majority of that time in Las Vegas, NV.\r\nLooking for some fun stuff to do. The kinds of things the locals\r\ndo that you don't read about in the travel guides.\r\n\r\n### Contributing\r\nPlease open a pull request or issue with your suggestion. I'll\r\nreview it, and if it tickles my fancy, I'll add it below. I'll add\r\nupdates in the form of mini-blogs, vlog, or photos.\r\n\r\nIf a local's pizza or taco suggestion gets shortlisted, lunch is on me!\r\n\r\nFor pizza suggestions, [please see here](https://github.com/xzyfer/us-travel-checklist/issues/5).\r\n\r\nFor taco suggestions, [please see here](https://github.com/xzyfer/us-travel-checklist/issues/13).\r\n\r\n\r\n### About me\r\nI'm a 25 year old Australian male web developer working for a successful\r\nweb start up.
